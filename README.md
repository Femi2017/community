# Tripetto Forms
[Tripetto Forms](https://forms.tripetto.community) bring a new way of creating and deploying forms in websites and applications. You use its intuitive graphical [editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tripetto/forms-editor) to build and edit smart forms with logic and conditional flows in 2D on a self-organizing drawing board. In any modern browser. Mouse, touch or pen.

Perhaps one of the best things about Tripetto Forms is that you can create your own [collectors](https://forms.tripetto.community/collector/) and [providers](https://forms.tripetto.community/providers/). A typical provider implements a certain form building block and allows for the management of its properties through the editor. We have a [boilerplate](https://gitlab.com/tripetto/forms/providers/boilerplate) to get you started.

This repository contains a list of collectors and providers available in the public (open source) domain. We hope other enthusiasts will also start to develop stuff for Tripetto Forms.

***If you have created a collector or provider yourself, create a PR and add yours to this list.***
