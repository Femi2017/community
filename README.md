Tripetto Forms is a full-fledged form kit. Its graphical [**editor**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tripetto/forms-editor) covers powerful form creation â€“ either stand-alone or as a brandable embedded solution. The supplementary [**collector**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tripetto/forms-collector) library handles form execution and response collection in any website or application. The UI is truly yours to rock. Also, you can extend both editor and collector with custom [**building blocks**](https://forms.tripetto.community/providers/) (e.g. question types).

# Collectors and providers
This repository contains a list of collectors and providers available in the public (open source) domain. We hope other enthusiasts will also start to develop stuff for Tripetto Forms.

*If you have created a collector or provider yourself, create a PR and add yours to this list.*
